GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 19 November 2007

Copyright (C) 2025 <Seu Nome ou Nome da Organização>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license
for software and other kinds of works of authorship.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains
free software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the AGPL also makes clear
that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and
developers' sake, the AGPL requires that modified versions be marked as
such, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

Some software would benefit from being released under the GNU Lesser
General Public License; others would benefit from being released under
the simple GNU General Public License. But the license for most
software and other practical works is the GNU Affero General Public
License, which allows developers to benefit from the use of the
software on servers as well as just on desktop computers.

The GNU Affero General Public License is essentially the GNU General
Public License, version 3, but with an additional term generally
requiring an Offer of Corresponding Source to any user interacting with
the licensed software remotely through a computer network. This is
intended to solve a problem that is often called the "ASP loophole".

The "ASP loophole" is that if you run a modified program on a server,
the server's users do not receive the source code or an offer to
receive it, because there is no "conveying" of the software itself.
The GNU Affero General Public License's additional term ensures that
users accessing the software through a network are still offered the
source code.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public
License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of
an exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission under applicable copyright law, would make you directly or
secondarily liable for infringement, except executing it on a computer
or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution
(with or without modification), mere public display, and in some
countries other activities as well.

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to
the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the
interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu,
a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

1. Source Code.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of
a work.

A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is
widely used among developers working in that language.

The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a major component, but which is not part of that major
component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
major component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form. A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and run the object code
and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.
However, it does not include the work's System Libraries or
generally available tools or highly specialized proprietary programs
such as linkers, preprocessors and text processors. For instance,
Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated
with source files for the work, and the source code for shared
libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data
communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts
of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in object code form is a subset
of that work's source code, in that it does not include the source
code for its System Libraries.

2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
without condition so long as your license otherwise remains in force.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11
of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar
laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights conveyed under this License with respect
to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, or to exercise, your
legal rights or the legal rights of third parties under the WIPO treaty
article 11 provisions or similar laws.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive
terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact
all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a
copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Program in source code form under
the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
conditions:

a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
it, and giving a relevant date.

b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This
requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all
notices".

c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License
to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will
therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms,
to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they
are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in
any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have
separately received it.

d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work
need not make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the Corresponding
Source in a medium customarily used for software interchange.

The Corresponding Source need not be included in the object code
conveyed and may be conveyed separately, but in no case may you delay
conveying the Corresponding Source longer than a year after the object
code is conveyed.

When you convey the object code, you can also convey a copy of the
Corresponding Source translated into a machine-readable form to provide
installation and modification capabilities, with Appropriate Legal
Notices according to section 4, but that must be accompanied by the
Corresponding Source itself, complete and in the form required by
section 1.

7. Additional Terms.

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a covered work, you may elect to remove any
additional permissions from that covered work that were included in
the modified Program, provided that you do not remove or alter any
copyright notices. You may place additional permissions on material,
added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give
appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders
of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

b) Requiring preservation of specified political notices or
pithy legal notices displayed in Appropriate Legal Notices, or
to include in the interface a list of these notices.

These are the only additional terms that may be placed on the covered
work. If a work has interactive user interfaces, a prominent item in
the list of user commands or options meets this criterion.

8. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the first
paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by any reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation (for any work) from that copyright holder,
and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the
notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any right to use it.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not
accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered
work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

11. Patents.

A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner of making,
using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims
that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification
of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, "control"
includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent
with the requirements of this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license in
which the Corresponding Source of the work is not available to anyone
for copying, free of charge and under the terms of this License, you
must: (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2)
arrange to supersede the patent license, or (3) communicate to the
party that you are conveying the work on a reliance basis, and cause
the party to cease distributing the covered work, or to obtain an
exception to the patent license until the Corresponding Source is
made available in the manner specified by this License.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or procure the conveyance of, a covered work,
and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered
work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific
copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is
automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works
based on it.

A patent license is "non-exclusive" if it is not a sublicense of an
exclusive patent license. Nothing in this License shall be construed to
prevent you from granting patent licenses under terms and conditions
separate from this License.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If you are unable to comply with all the terms of this License
simultaneously due to statute or judicial order, you may not convey any
of the covered work. For example, if a patent license would not permit
redistribution by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly
through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this
License would be to refrain entirely from propagation of the covered
work.

13. Use with the GNU General Public License.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
and the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3 will apply
to the part which is the work licensed under the GNU General
Public License version 3.

If you modify the Program, and include library functions of a type
which are customarily used to enable application programs to communicate
with an operating system, or to use utilities or operating system
features, and you wish to permit their use by non-free programs, you
can change the Program's license to one that is functionally equivalent
to the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3, but which must
include the Affero clause.

14. Affero General Public License.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if the program
supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
Source of your version by transmitting it to them upon request, in a
network server standard format, free of charge, upon transmission. If
the work has interactive user interfaces, a prominent item in any such
interface's list of user commands or options meets this criterion. This
section is an addition to section 13.

15. No Warranty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE COVERED WORK, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE COVERED WORK "AS IS" WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED WORK IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE COVERED WORK
PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR
CONVEYS THE COVERED WORK AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED WORK
(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
THE COVERED WORK TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH
HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a guarantee or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as
    published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the
    License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program has interactive user interfaces, make them display
"Appropriate Legal Notices".  For example, if you use X windows,
set the variable `resource_name.copyright' to a string of copyright
notices, and make the program display them.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
